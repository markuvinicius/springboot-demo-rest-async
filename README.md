# springboot-demo-rest-async
A spring boot rest api that consumes a bunch of services asynchronously. This project was built as a POC for CompletableFuture async calls and JVM Tunning

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install:

* [Java OpenJDK 1.11](https://openjdk.java.net/install/)
* [Maven 3.3.6](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
* [NodeJS V14.4.4](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (optional, but recommended)

## Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

### Build

```
mvn clean package
```

### Set-UP the Mock Rest APIs

To start-up the mock Rest APIs, just follow

```sh
cd mock-rest-api
nvm use ## if you are using nvm
npm i ## yarn i
npm start 3000 3010
```

This commands will install the project dependencies and start 11 nodeJs processes exposing a rest endpoint at http://localhost:{port}/
The {port} list will start from 3000 to 3010

### Running the application

To run the application locally, do the following:

```
cd springboot-demo-rest-async
chmod a+x start_java_application.sh
./start_java_application.sh
```

After running, you can start making GET requests to the application on the endpoint http://localhost:8080/async
